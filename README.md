## 🚀 Key Features and Technology

| Component | Description | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Core** | Risk is visualized in real-time on a **3D Heart Model**, using color and intensity to communicate risk level. | Provides an **intuitive, non-numeric** understanding of risk. |
| **The Engine** | Powered by a trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for rapid pattern recognition from high-quality data. | Ensures **highly accurate** predictions based on visual inputs. |
| **Speed** | Designed for **Instant Predictions** by eliminating the latency (delay) of traditional API callbacks. | Guarantees **real-time feedback** essential for critical operations. |
| **Architecture** | Built on a **Decoupled Architecture** with support for **Swappable 3D Objects**. | Ensures the system is **flexible, maintainable, and scalable**. |
